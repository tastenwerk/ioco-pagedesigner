  "content": "<p>When his brother Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old King Edward V. As the young king travelled to London from Ludlow, Richard met and escorted him to lodgings in the Tower of London where Edward V's brother Richard joined him. Arrangements were made for Edward's coronation on 22 June 1483, but before the young king could be crowned, his father's marriage to his mother Elizabeth Woodville was declared invalid, making their children illegitimate and ineligible for the throne. On 25 June an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed the claims. The following day, Richard III began his reign and he was crowned on 6 July 1483. The young princes were not seen in public after August and a number of accusations circulated that the boys had been murdered by Richard, giving rise to the legend of the Princes in the Tower.</p>",
