  "content": "<p>There were two major rebellions against Richard. The first, in October 1483, was led by staunch allies of Edward IV[1] and also by Richard's former ally, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham,[2] his first cousin once removed.[3] The revolt collapsed and Stafford was executed at Salisbury near the Bull's Head Inn. In August 1485, another rebellion against Richard was led by Henry Tudor and his uncle, Jasper Tudor. Henry Tudor landed in his birthplace, Pembrokeshire, with a small contingent of French troops, and marched through Wales recruiting foot soldiers and skilled archers. Richard died during the Battle of Bosworth Field, the last English king to die in battle (and the only one to die in battle on English soil since Harold II at the Battle of Hastings in 1066).</p>",
